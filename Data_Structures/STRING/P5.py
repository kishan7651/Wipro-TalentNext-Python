#Given a string and an integer n, return a string made of n repetitions of the last n characters of the string. You may assume that n is between 0 and the length of the string inclusive. For example if the inputs are “Wipro” and 3, then the output should be “propropro”.

string = input("Enter a string: ")
n = int(input("Enter n: "))

last_part = string[-n:]

print(last_part * n)
